# Universal-Game-Launcher
Universal Game Launcher is a lightweight, GUI-based utility designed to replace complex and messy .bat files for self-hosted games and hobbyist projects. It allows users to manage multiple game profiles, visually edit launch arguments, and resolve domain names (DDNS) into IP addresses all without ever touching a command prompt or a text editor.
